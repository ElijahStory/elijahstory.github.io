                My name is Elijah Story. I graduated from the University of Maine with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in New Media. I really enjoy the process of solving a problem with code. I love putting myself in others shoes to make something that could make a task easier in their job or in everyday life. Because I have taken many different kinds of CS classes, had different kinds of summer internships, and taken many New Media courses, I have been exposed to many different programming languages and applications and like to consider myself a quick learner.            </div>

                    <p class="carousel_text">Working at the Advanced Structures and Composites Center, I worked on a research project involving Object Oriented Bounding Boxes for 3D objects. The bigger and more exciting project was developing software for in house use that allows the user to view and manipulate 3D objects. For that project I got to learn Vue.js and three.js which I have already taken into other personal projects.</p>

I got to code a couple of different applications to help automate/streamline a few of their tedious processes. The biggest thing was creating a program to assess the acceptance testing of a supercomputer.</p>

This was a fun project and is one that I am going to recreate in an actual game engine at some point in the future!

For my final project in that class I made a side scrolling game. It was a really neat project learning how to use object oriented programming for the first time and I got to work on my pixel art skills. <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/elijah.story/full/p125xNCJt" target="_blank">Check it out here!</a></p>
